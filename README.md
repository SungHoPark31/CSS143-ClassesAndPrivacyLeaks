# CSS143-ClassesAndPrivacyLeaks
The purpose of this lab is to write some classes that you will be
using in later assignments, to explore the issue of privacy leaks,
to consider testing, and to write some larger classes with more methods.

Build three classes (Money, Date and Bill) for use in managing a set of
outstanding and paid bills.  Submit these three classes and a test driver
(4 files total, 5 if you have both driver and Junit tests) that exercises
all functionality for these classes.  Submit only the .java source code 
files inside a single .zip file. In this assignment, weâ€™ll explore class
composition, accessors and mutators, privacy leaks, toString(), and equals().
